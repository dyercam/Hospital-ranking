## This is the ReadMe for the hospital ranking code.
## Note: The dataset was supplied from JHU's Data science course. The Functions were made in line with the requirements for the assignment.


## The code written in this project creates functions to look through a database filled with information about different hospitals in the United states. 
## This ReadMe has barebones information on how to properly use those functions.


rankhospital:

rankhospital(state, outcome, num = "best")

## Rankhospital takes two required inputs, and one optional input

  ## state: the abbreviation of a state, such as "MD", "AL", "CA", etc
  ## outcome: takes one of three inputs, "heart failure", "heart attack", or "pneumonia"
  ##num: automatically set to "best", but will also take "worst", or a numeric input as well

## returns the hospital that is the best, worst, or the specific numeric input based on the given outcome

ex:
rankhospital("MD", "heart attack")
rankhospital("TX", "heart failure", "worst")


best:

best(state, outcome)

## best takes two required inputs

  ## state: the abbreviatione of a state, such as "MD", "AL, "CA", etc
  ## outcome: takes one of three inputs, "heart failure", "heart attack", or "pneumonia"

## returns the best hospital in the given state for the given outcome

ex:
best("MD", "heart attack")



rankall:

rankall(outcome, num="best")

## rankall takes one required input, and one optional input

  ## outcome: takes one of three inputs, "heart failure", "heart attack", or "pneumonia"
  ## num: automatically set to "best" if no input is given, but will also take "worst", or a numeric input as well

## returns a list of hospitals that are the best or worst, given the proper input (or ranked from the numeric input), based on the given outcome.

ex:
rankall("heart attack")
rankhospital("heart failure", 13)
