## This is the ReadMe for the hospital ranking code.

## The code written in this project creates functions to look through a database filled with information about different hospitals in the United states. 
## This ReadMe has barebones information on how to properly use those functions.


rankhospital:

rankhospital(state, outcome, num = "best")

## Rankhospital takes two required inputs, and one optional input

  ## state: the abbreviation of a state, such as "MD", "AL", "CA", etc
  ## outcome: takes one of three inputs, "heart failure", "heart attack", or "pneumonia"
  ##num: automatically set to "best", but you can also input "worst"

ex:
rankhospital("MD", "heart attack")
rankhospital("TX", "heart failure", "worst")
